#### Task Descrition 
Build a **responsive** good looking LandingPage and practice my new JavaScript knowledge by add:
- Feature of adding new sections with its navigition item.
- Navigition link which points to each section.

#### How it works
- After page content is loaded it'll dynamically build the navigation bar and add onclick event listener to each of navItems.
- Each navItem has the same title of its linked section.
- You can easily,**smoothly** get to a specific section just by clicking its navItem.
- If any section is in view ,its navItem is immediately highlighted.
- You can any time add new section and its navItem will be build automatically.
